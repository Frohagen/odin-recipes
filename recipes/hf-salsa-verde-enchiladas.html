<h3>Description</h3>
    <P>
        Saucy, smothered, hearty, and delicious: This enchilada
        bake has everything you could possibly want. You’ll make it 
        by wrapping tortillas around a filling of poblano pepper, tomato, 
        and beans, then coating the bundles with a healthy glug of mild green 
        salsa and a sprinkle of Monterey Jack cheese. Put it in the oven and 
        let it get piping hot and bubbly, and all you’ll have left to do 
        is add a drizzle of spiced sour cream and dig in to that deliciousness.

        <li>1 unit Roma Tomato</li> 
        <li>13.4 ounce Black Beans</li>   
        <li>1 tablespoon Southwest Spice Blend</li>
        <li>6 unit Flour Tortillas (ContainsWheat)</li>
        <li>7.06 ounce Green Salsa</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Monterey Jack Cheese (ContainsMilk)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon Sour Cream (ContainsMilk)</li>
        <li>1 unit Chili Pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Butter (ContainsMilk)i</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 475 degrees. 
            Wash and dry all produce. • Core, deseed, and dice poblano. 
            Finely dice tomato. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating 
            whites from greens. Drain beans over a small bowl, reserving 
            liquid. Thinly slice chili.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. 
            Add poblano and cook until just softened, 3-4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, reserve ½ tsp Southwest Spice (1 tsp for 4 servings) 
            in a second small bowl for step 6. • Once poblano is just 
            softened, add tomato, scallion whites, half the beans, 2 TBSP 
            reserved bean liquid (you'll use the remaining beans and more 
            bean liquid in the next step), and remaining Southwest Spice 
            to pan. Cook, stirring, until fragrant and warmed through, 
            2-3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a large drizzle of oil in a small pot over medium-high 
            heat. Add remaining beans and cook, stirring, until slightly 
            softened, 2-3 minutes. • Add 3 TBSP reserved bean liquid 
            (1/3 cup for 4 servings). (You may have some bean liquid 
            left over.) Simmer until warmed through, 1-2 minutes. 
            • Reduce heat to low and stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4). 
            • Turn off heat; mash with a potato masher or fork until mostly 
            smooth. Season with plenty of salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Spread tortillas with mashed beans. Place a small amount of 
            filling on one half of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas, 
            starting with filled sides, and place seam sides down in an 
            8-by-11-inch baking dish or ovenproof pan. (For 4 servings, 
            place in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or two smaller ones.) 
            • Spoon enough salsa over to generously coat (you may have 
            some left over). Sprinkle with Monterey Jack. • Bake on top 
            rack until salsa is bubbly and cheese melts, 3-5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>While enchiladas bake, add sour cream to bowl with reserved 
            Southwest Spice. Stir in warm water 1 tsp at a time until 
            mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and 
            pepper. • Top baked enchiladas with crema, scallion greens, 
            and as much chili as you like. Divide between plates and serve.
