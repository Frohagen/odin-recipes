    <P>
        It's hard NOT to love any ingredient when it's fritter-fied, aka 
        mixed into a batter and cooked until perfectly golden. This 
        falafel-inspired version stars chickpeas, which we mash, then 
        combine with a light tempura batter with shawarma spices, fresh dill, 
        shallot, and garlic. They're shallow-fried, pancake-style, until 
        crispy, then paired with some of our favorite mezze platter 
        accompaniments: fluffy pita bread, a refreshing Greek salad, salty 
        feta, and a creamy, garlicky white sauce. Now comes the most 
        challenging part of the meal: stacking a little bit of everything 
        on your fork at once to create the perfect bite!

    <ul>
        <li>1 unit Persian Cucumber</li>
        <li>1 unit Shallot</li>
        <li>1 unit Roma Tomato/li>
        <li>1/4 ounce Dill</li>          
        <li>1 unit Lemon</li>
        <li>1 clove Garlic</li> 
        <li>1/2 cup Feta Cheese (Contains Milk)</li>   
        <li>13.4 ounce Chickpeas</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Shawarma Spice Blend</li>
        <li>6 tablespoon Sour Cream (Contains Milk)</li>
        <li>82 g Tempura Mix (Contains Milk, Eggs, Wheat)</li>
        <li>2 unit Whole Wheat Pitas (Contains Wheat)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. 
            (TIP: If you have a toaster oven, feel free to skip 
            preheating—you'll use it to warm the pitas in step 5.) Wash 
            and dry produce. • Trim and halve cucumber lengthwise; thinly 
            slice crosswise into half-moons. Dice tomato. Halve, peel, and 
            thinly slice half the shallot; mince remaining shallot. Pick 
            and roughly chop fronds from dill. Quarter lemon. Peel and 
            mince or grate garlic.
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine cucumber, tomato, sliced shallot, 
            half the chopped dill, and half the feta (save the rest for 
            serving). Stir in a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of 
            lemon juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper. • In a 
            separate small bowl, combine sour cream with a pinch of garlic 
            to taste. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches 
            a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Drain and rinse chickpeas. Place in a medium bowl and mash 
            with a potato masher or fork until almost smooth. (It's OK if 
            there are still some larger chickpea pieces.) • In a large 
            bowl, whisk together tempura mix, Shawarma Spice, salt (we 
            used ¾ tsp; 1½ tsp for 4 servings), and 1/3 cup water until 
            smooth. (For 4, use 2/3 cup water.) • Stir in mashed chickpeas, 
            minced shallot, remaining garlic, and remaining chopped dill. 
            Season with pepper. TIP: If mixture is too thick, add more 
            water 1 TBSP at a time until it reaches a pancake-batter-like 
            consistency.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a 1/3-inch layer of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan 
            over medium- high heat. Once oil is shimmering and hot enough 
            that a drop of batter sizzles when added to the pan, carefully 
            add heaping ¼-cup scoops of chickpea batter. TIP: Add your 
            batter to the pan close to the oil to avoid splatter. You 
            may need to cook fritters in batches. • Cook fritters until 
            golden brown and crisp, 3-4 minutes per side. • Using a 
            slotted spoon, carefully transfer fritters to a 
            paper-towel-lined plate. Season with a pinch of salt. Turn 
            off heat.
        </li>
        <li>While fritters cook, warm pitas on top rack (use a baking 
            sheet or place directly on oven rack) until pliable. Halve 
            crosswise. TIP: You can use your toaster oven instead, if 
            you have one. Keep an eye on the pitas as they warm—they 
            should be soft, not crispy.
        </li>
        <li>Divide fritters and salad (draining first) between plates. 
            Top with remaining feta. Serve with pitas, sauce, and 
            any remaining lemon wedges on the side. TIP: If you like, 
            stuff pitas with fritters and salad, then drizzle with 
            sauce for falafel-inspired sandwiches!
