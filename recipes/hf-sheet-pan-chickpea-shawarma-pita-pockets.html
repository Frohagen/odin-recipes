    <ul>
        <li>4 ounce Grape Tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Feta Cheese (Contains Milk)</li>            
        <li>1 unit Persian Cucumber</li> 
        <li>1 tablespoon Shawarma Spice Blend</li>   
        <li>6 tablespoon Southwest Sour Cream (Contains Milk)</li>
        <li>1/4 ounce Dill</li>
        <li>4 tablespoon Hummus</li>
        <li>13.4 ounce Chickpeas</li>
        <li>2 unit Whole Wheat Pitas (ContainsWheat)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. 
            Drain and rinse chickpeas; dry thoroughly with paper towels. 
            Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, Shawarma Spice, 
            salt, and pepper. • Roast on top rack until browned and 
            crisp, 18-20 minutes. TIP: It's natural for chickpeas to 
            pop a bit while roasting.
        </li>
        <li>While chickpeas roast, wash and dry all produce. Halve tomatoes. 
            Trim and halve cucumber lengthwise; thinly slice 
            crosswise into half-moons. Pick and roughly chop fronds from dill.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss together tomatoes, cucumber, chopped 
            dill, feta, and a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and 
            pepper. • Toast pitas until warm and pliable. Halve each pita 
            crosswise to create pockets.
        </li>
        <li>Spread hummus and sour cream inside of each pita pocket. 
            Fill with as many chickpeas as you like (you may have some 
            left over) and a small amount of salad. • Divide stuffed pita 
            pockets between plates. Serve with remaining salad on the 
            side. TIP: Sprinkle your salad with any remaining chickpeas 
            for a crunchy, crouton like topper!
