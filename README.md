Project Recipes for TOP Foundations Path under HTML Foundations Section

This is the Recipes Project in the HTML Foundations section of The Odin Project's Foundations Path. In this project, I will be putting into practice some of the basic HTML skills that I am learning to build a very basic website with no CSS styling (for now). This will involve creating a repository on GitHub, using Git for version control and commits, writing HTML, and providing good commit messages (05/12/2022).
